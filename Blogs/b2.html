            <h1>The Emergence of E-Commerce</h1>
            <h3><cite>Author: Brendan Jackson</cite></h3>

        <section>
            <p>Perhaps one of the most important things to occur in the history of the internet is the emergence of
                e-commerce and the growth of the e-commerce sector. E-commerce first became possible in 1991. Some of
                the
                first companies to allow online financial transactions are still some of the biggest e-commerce sites
                that
                exist today. These sites are none other than Amazon and Ebay which normalized the purchasing of goods
                over
                the internet. These days it is not only limited to goods but also services and entertainment. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>One of the greatest features of e-commerce is the ability of a user to review products as well as read
                reviews by other users. This allows users to know more about the product they are buying thanks to other
                users, something that previously would not be possible in a physical store unless specifically reviewed
                by
                an in-person acquaintance. This is thanks to internet connecting people from all around the world to
                share
                their knowledge.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>E-commerce has led to the world becoming a global marketplace, consumers having access to products and
                services that may previously never have been accessible to them, as well as suppliers having a far wider
                customer base.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Without a doubt the internet and the emergence of e-commerce sites has forever changed the way in which
                businesses sell their goods and services, from the large corporations such as Amazon to the one person
                business selling their handmade goods on Etsy, business will never be the same thanks to the internet.
