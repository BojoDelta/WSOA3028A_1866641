            <h1>Interactivity on The World Wide Web</h1>

            <p>Gone are the days of users seeking nothing but static information, rather they seek something greater,
                immersion and interactivity. Almost all websites that are created and exist on the web today contain a
                level
                of interactivity, whether this be in the form of browser based games, online clickable slideshows,
                avatar
                customizable apps, or even something as simple as a button that can be clicked, interaction comes in
                many
                forms.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Interaction plays a vital role on websites. It keeps the user interested and engaged with the content on
                the
                page, the longer the user stays engaged with the page's content the more the page achieves it's goal of
                presenting as much of it's content as it can to the user. Humans by nature are creatures that enjoy
                interacting with something in order to better understand it, for example when someone shows an item or
                object to another person, their first reaction is to want to hold and touch the object and to experience
                the
                object in a tangible way. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>In the context of a website and the internet, this tangible experience is created through the use of
                interactive elements in order to familiarise the user with the content of the website. Another
                interesting
                facet of web interactivity is the ability to make a user's interactivity more social for example on the
                music streaming platform Spotify, users are able to interact by creating their own unique playlists that
                are
                custom suited to their tastes. Spotify makes this interactivity more social by giving users the ability
                to
                share their playlists with friends and listen to them simultaneously with friends, this further makes
                the
                features and content of this site more engaging and interactable.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Some interesting examples of web interactivity include the website of Funko POP, a website designed with
                the
                purpose of showcasing the various POP figurines produced by the company. One of the interactable
                features of
                the site is allowing users to create and design their own POP figurines <a
                    href="https://www.funko.com/pop-yourself">Here</a>. This figurine that is created can be shared and
                also
                used as the user's avatar on the Funko website and application.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>In conclusion web interactivity is a vital part of websites and web design as it prompts the user to stay
                engaged with the site's content and interact with this content in meaningful ways.</p>
