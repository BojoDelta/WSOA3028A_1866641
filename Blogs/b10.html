            <h1>Towards a study of Information Geographies Reflection</h1>

        <section>
            <p>The digital divide has often simply been labeled as the difference between those who have and those who
                have not, the haves and the haven’ts. But this divide can be further examined into who is creating the
                content that users around the world are either able to or not able to access.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>When looking at various maps depicting where in various parts of the world this information is being
                created and generated it becomes much easier to see the divide in this respect. These areas can largely
                be split into 2 major categories / geographies: The Global North and The Global South.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>The Global North can largely be surmised as the United States of America, large portions of Europe and
                smaller parts of Asia; some of the superpower nations of the world. Whereas the global South comprises
                largely of the rest of the world in particular Africa, South America and other ‘poorer’ regions of the
                world.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>What is interesting to note is that the areas of the globe which are dominating in terms of content and
                information being created directly correlate to the areas of the globe where internet access is
                significantly cheaper than those areas where the rate of information and content creation is severely
                far behind.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Thus, a direct correlation can be drawn between the geographies of where information is being generated
                and access this information. This further disadvantages the have nots as they are being further and
                further sidelined from these information hyper lanes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>The Global South has a far deeper market penetration in the use of mobile devices for internet access
                than the Global North, in particular regions such as Africa and Asia have extremely high rates of mobile
                device use for access as opposed to other devices. If more information content creation was suited to
                mobile devices then I believe that over time we would see these information geographies begin to change
                to reflect a greater level of equality when the different regions.</p>
