            <p>The world has been thrown into absolute turmoil during the current COVID-19 Pandemic. Lives are being
                lost
                daily and immense measures need to be implemented in order to prevent the loss of life of many more
                people.
                One of these measures that has been implemented all around the world is the temporary closing of
                educational
                institutes from Primary Education all the way to Tertiary level education institutes. However the
                learning
                must continue even when students cannot physically attend a class or lecture, but how is this achieved?
                Never before in the history of humand-kind and the internet has internet conectivity been such a vital
                necessity of paramount importance.

            </p>
            <p>Many educational institutes world wide have adopted an online learning approach making use of various
                internet technologies to facilitate learning such as ZOOM, MS Teams, Webex, Skype, Discord and numerous
                othr
                softwares, however these technologies come with certain implications that could lead to other problems
                such
                as disadvantaging certain students. These implications include lack of data and bandwidth issues as well
                as
                lack of access to various technologies such as software that has certain hardware requirements in order
                to
                run, like microphones and web cameras.</p>

        <section>
            <p>One solution to distance learning is the streaming and sharing of video lessons by teachers and lecturors
                however students that have limited data plans and network connectivity could potentially be negatively
                impacted by this as they may not be always able to access the videos and streams and thus are not
                recieving
                all the information needed for their field of study.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Another solution to distance learning is the utilisation of television and radio networks. This would not
                be
                an optimal solution for subjects that do not have a large number of students, however in the instance of
                subjects such as Matric Maths and Science this platform could serve as alternate method of distance
                learning
                for students.</p>

        <section>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic will have forever changed numerous aspects of our daily lives whether it be the
                loss of
                loved ones, unemployment, financial crashes and various other factors. When it comes to the continuation
                of
                education during this pandemic all efforts must be put into ensuring that no student is disadvantaged by
                any
                technologies that are used and that all students have an equal oportunity for education.</p>
