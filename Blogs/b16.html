            <h1>External Dependency</h1>

                External dependencies are phenomenal tools for transforming a website from being a static boring site to
                being a dynamic site full of interactivity based upon the user of the site.

                For the purpose of this site my original intention was to make use of the <a
                    href=https://superheroapi.com/index.html>Superhero Database API</a> in order to randomly choose a
                superhero character for the user of the site to cosplay. This would give the user the ability to visit
                the site for cosplay inspiration when in doubt of which character they should cosplay next. This would
                have greatly suited the theme of the website. The issue in this implementation arose however when I was
                unable to get this API to work correctly with my site.
                Attempting to use the API resulted in 429 errors related to too many requests. I was unable to implement
                this API in my site, as a result I needed to implement a new external dependency.

                Unfortunately the only API I was able to implement into the site in the remaining time was an API used
                for fetching jokes. I have also included the implementation of a live Twitter feed related to my
                character on the about page however I am uncertain as to wether this constitutes an external dependency.
                The purpose of including the live Twitter feed is to show that the character is someone who is fairly
                active on social media and has a high social media presence.

            <p>External dependencies can dramatically transform the purpose and fcuntionality of a website in order to
                perform tasks such as present users with playlists, give users directions or even display geo data based
                upon people around the world discussing topics on Twitter, and whilst I see the great potential of these
                frameworks and dependencies, I feel that I lack the technical knowledge required to implement these
                features
                into my site.</p>
