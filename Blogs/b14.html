            <p>With regards to cosplay materials, South Africa as a whole does not have a large amount of access to the
                various fabrics and materials used to build a cosplay, however with a little insider's knowledge I'll be
                able to send you on your way to find all the materials you could possibly need to make your dream
                cosplay a reality.

            <p>Foam: The base of almost 90% of all cosplay armors are built from EVA foam, but sometimes it is not the
                easiest material to find. The 2 most common form of EVA foam are foam floor mats and rolls of plain EVA.
                Floor mats are the preferred material of choice for beginner cosplayers due to it's relatively lower
                price range and these floor mats can be found at the following shops in Johannesburg and South Africa:
                Westpack, Makro, Sportsman's Warehouse and Mr Price Sport. On the other hand plain rolls of EVA foam are
                more expensive and can only really be found at one loaction in Johannesburg, that being Sondor
                Performance foams located in Edenvale.</p>

            <p>Imagine miles and miles of fabric laid out before you. That's exactly what await you at Chamdor, one of
                the biggest fabric stores in Johannesburg. Chamdor has multiple branches spread out across Johannesburg.

            <p>With regards to glue and paint I always find that my local arts and crafts store is the ideal place to
                pickup some of the more common items that I need for my cosplays. Herbert Evans located in Fourways is
                also an excellent store for finding all sort of various crafting materials from cutting mats to wood
                burning tools.</p>

            <p>I hope this guide helps you to find the materials you need to build your next cosplay.</p>
