        <section>
            <p>I am white privileged male alive during the time of human technology at its peak, so what do I know of
                the digital divide? The truth is nothing much.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>I have grown up in a middle-class family with access to technology and all the information of humankind
                at my fingertips. But do I really have access to ALL the information of humankind? Well on surface value
                yes, pretty much anything I have ever wanted to know is but a few mere keystrokes and clicks away from
                me.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>But what about the data and information that I am not purposefully looking for. What about the
                information and content that is aggregated and tailored specifically towards me and my interests based
                upon previous interactions with data and information the web? Big Data is no new term and digital
                companies have for years been tailoring what sorts of information a user will see on their site but is
                this tailoring of data creating more problems than it solves.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>We all enjoy jumping onto YouTube and be greeted with videos by channels we enjoy and content that
                appeals to our interests, but this filtering of content is in a sense ‘gate-keeping’ us from discovering
                new content.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>I know that sometimes I can be guilty of not wanting to discover anything new because I know what I like
                and I don’t want anything else. This is one thing when it comes to entertainment content creation such
                as videos and music but what about targeted ads, political content etc?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Should big tech companies be dictating what we see when we aren’t even aware that it’s being presented to
                us? The digital divide is no longer only about access to technology and information but also why type of
                information we are presented with. Tech companies whilst at the end of the day are aiming to generate a
                profit should strive to create features that do not further enable this divide but rather present all
                information to the user as equal, particularly in the case of serious information such as political
                campaigns etc.</p>
