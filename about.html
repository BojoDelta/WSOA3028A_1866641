        <h1>About Jax Cosplay</h1>
        <img src="Images/CharImage9.jpg" alt="Jax Cosplaying as Elrond, kneeling" height="400">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Jax is a South African cosplay artist living in Johannesburg. He has been cosplaying for 6 years and plans to
            continue cosplaying for many years to come. Jax is a self taught artist, learning most of his skills from
            YouTube or trial and error. Jax has been building and making things for as long as he can remember often
            spending hours in his grandfather's workshop as a young child tinkering away at whatever project it was that
            he was working on.</p>
        <h2>Jax's Cosplay Style</h2>
        <p>Jax is well known in the South African cosplay community for building cosplays based upon Science Fiction and
            Fantasy. His true expertise is in the field of building armour and props, although he does occasionally
            branch out into the realm of fabric and sewn cosplays. Jax is also a fan of building cosplays based upon fan
            art by other artists.</p>
        <h2>What Jax is Currently Working On</h2>
        <p>Jax is currently working on 3 builds at the moment. These include Hades from the Disney film Hercules and
            Clone Commander Doom from Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Jax's major project that he is working on at the moment
            is the Witch-King of Angmar from The Lord of the Rings, however the character has been reimagined in a
            Steampunk Universe. Jax is working on these cosplays for the upcoming South African Convention Season. Jax
            hopes to enter the African Championships of Cosplay hosted at Comic Con Africa once again, having placed in
            the finals last year.</p>
