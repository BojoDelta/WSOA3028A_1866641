            <h1>Reflection on "As we may Think" by Vannebar Bush</h1>
            <h3>Author: Jax Cosplay</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Upon having read “As we may Think” by Vannebar Bush, I cant help but feel that Bush would be both surprised
            and amazed by the internet of our modern culture. There is no doubt about the fact that major similarities
            can drawn between his described Machine of the future and the technology that we have access to at the tips
            of our fingers.</p>
        <p>Bush talks about the advantages of being able to share information and knowledge with other researchers and
            yet a mere 75 years after Bush shared his vision and dream almost 80% of the entire human population has
            access to the great wealth that is all human knowledge with just a few keystrokes. Not only is this
            technology available to the academics and researchers of the world but rather to the common man. Any person
            with an active internet connection can have the answer to any question in a few moments, and moreover they
            are able to share their knowledge and experiences with the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>In his work Bush describes a trail of information that can be added to, amended by and increased by 1 person
            to another. This great trail of information exists today and resides at the web address of Wikipedia.com.
            Never before has there been such a large collection of information available to almost every person on the
            planet. One can only think of the possibilities that will emerge in the next 75 years as a result of this
            great shared knowledge, and I for one am excited to see where this river of information leads us.</p>

            <h1>The Emergence of E-Commerce</h1>
            <h3>Author: Jax Cosplay</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Perhaps one of the most important things to occur in the history of the internet is the emergence of
            e-commerce and the growth of the e-commerce sector. E-commerce first became possible in 1991. Some of the
            first companies to allow online financial transactions are still some of the biggest e-commerce sites that
            exist today. These sites are none other than Amazon and Ebay which normalized the purchasing of goods over
            the internet. These days it is not only limited to goods but also services and entertainment. </p>
        <p>One of the greatest features of e-commerce is the ability of a user to review products as well as read
            reviews by other users. This allows users to know more about the product they are buying thanks to other
            users, something that previously would not be possible in a physical store unless specifically reviewed by
            an in-person acquaintance. This is thanks to internet connecting people from all around the world to share
            their knowledge.</p>
        <p>E-commerce has led to the world becoming a global marketplace, consumers having access to products and
            services that may previously never have been accessible to them, as well as suppliers having a far wider
            customer base.</p>
        <p>Without a doubt the internet and the emergence of e-commerce sites has forever changed the way in which
            businesses sell their goods and services, from the large corporations such as Amazon to the one person
            business selling their handmade goods on Etsy, business will never be the same thanks to the internet.</p>

            <h1>Semantic Markup and it's uses</h1>
            <h3>Author: Jax Cosplay</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Gone are the days of web pages just presenting information, but rather web pages now have meaning to them.
            What is meant by this, well semantic markup is what I mean. In days gone by HTML and the tags used by it
            were used in order to present the information of the website to the user of the site. As the word semantic
            suggests, these tags now posses a dual function: to present the information as well as give meaning as to
            the type of information that is being presented.</p>
        <p>Whilst semantic markup and it’s effects is not often seen by the user, one of the greatest advantages of
            semantic markup is making it easier for a webpage to be understood by the browser that is displaying the
            page, the developers working on / maintaining the page and for the bots of the internet that crawl through
            webpages attempting to understand what type of content is presented on various pages. These tags also
            indicate the importance of the data on the webpage.</p>
        <p>One of the other advantages of using semantic markup is that it makes it easier to style the website when
            using JavaScript or CSS. It also makes it easier for a webpage to be displayed on various different
            platforms, as without semantic markup the purpose and meaning information on the page may be lost when the
            page is used on an uncommon platform, however with the use of semantics the platform will do it’s best to
            better understand what is being presented.</p>

            <h1>Data about data, that's meta</h1>
            <h3>Author: Jax Cosplay</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Data about data, well I guess you could say that’s quite meta…oh wait that already exists, and is aptly named
            metadata. In terms of the World Wide Web, metadata refers to the data about the webpages that are presented
            to a user, however this data is often never seen by the user. </p>
        <p>In an age where everyone wants people to be able to access the information that they are trying to share with
            the world, metadata is one of the most important factors to consider. Whilst this data is never seen by the
            user, it is seen by the bots that crawl your webpage, the browser that displays the page and the search
            engines used to find your content.</p>
        <p>Using metadata will make your website more accessible as search engines will have greater knowledge about the
            site such as, who created the site, what content can be found on the site and other information relating to
            the site that users may be searching for.</p>
        <p>Metadata can be implemented on HTML sites through the use of the
            <meta> tag. Using this tag a developer can edit the various attributes of the metadata such as who the
            author is, the description of the website and various other attributes related to the metadata. Thus if a
            user were to search for a certain author name, websites containing that author’s name in the metadata would
            be displayed.</p>
        <p>Metadata is a useful tool for describing what data is being presented.</p>
