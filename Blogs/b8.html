            <p>Her name was announced, the confetti fell from above, the crowd went wild with screams of elation, joy,
                admiration and sheer awe. JinxKittie Cosplay from South Africa was crowned as The Crown Champion of
                International Cosplay at C2E2. Kelsey Atkins, or as she is more commonly known Jinx/JinxKittie was the
                2020
                Crown Cosplay Champion for her cosplay of Blood Priestess Bathory designed by none other than
                CinderysArt.

            <p>More than 1000 hours of work were poured into the amazing cosplay that she crafted and first showed to
                the
                world at Comic Con Africa 2019. I personally feel so inspired, inspired that I too one day can compete
                at
                the
                C2E2 championships to represent South Africa.</p>

        <section>
            <p>I remember the first time I ever laid eyes on this beautiful work of art. It was as I was leaving the
                cosplay
                change rooms of CCA 2019 that I was absolutely dumbstruck by the details, craftmanship and sheer beauty
                of
                Jinx's cosplay. I wished in that moment that I could one day be able to create something of that level
                of
                beauty and skill.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>I wish to extend my greatest congratulations to JinxKittie on her achievement and also to say thank you
                for
                inspiring me to be the best cosplayer that I can possibly be. You are truly deserving of the title of
                Queen
                of Cosplay and seeing your cosplay in person will forever be one of my greatest cosplay memories.</p>
