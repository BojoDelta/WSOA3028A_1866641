            <h1>User Interface and Experience, why the User matters</h1>
            <h3><cite>Author: Brendan Jackson</cite></h3>
        </header>
        <p>When it comes to websites and web design the user is perhaps the most important thing to consider because at
            the end of the day the user is the target of the website, it is who they are trying to present their content
            to in the most meaningful, impactful and efficient way possible. That is why web pages and sites need to be
            designed in such a way that any user can successfully navigate and interact with the web page in a
            constructive manner that allows them to access the content they want to see, and for the page to present its
            content to the user.
        </p>
        <p>A website's user interface should be relatively simple to understand so that the user can get the most out of
            the site as possible instead of having to struggle on having to understand how to use the site. When the
            site has an interface that is simple to navigate, easy to understand and use and satisfying to the user, the
            user is more likely to interact with the site in meaningful ways such as purchasing products advertised on
            the site, engaging with interactive elements of the site and overall using the site as it was intended by
            the developer of the site and achieving the goals of the site. </p>
        <p>User experience is not only something that exists on the web and on digital platforms but rather it exists
            in every single thing that we as humans interact with whether it be something as simple as opening a door
            based on things such as the door handle indicating that it needs to be pushed, pulled or turned or something
            more complex such as operating machinery that has numerous dials and knobs to operate it.</p>
        <p>Users are more likely to respond in a positive manner to a system that utlises a system that is simple and
            easy to use and also makes the experience an enjoyable one for the user. Making the experience enjoyable for
            the user can be achieved in a variety of ways, one of these methods to make the experience enjoyable is a
            well polished feedback system where the actions of the user are rewarded with various feedback cues such as
            audio notifications to indicate that a task has been completed or visual notifications that the user has new
            messages for example. These rewards give the user a pleasurable experience whilst interacting with the site
            thus encouraging the user to interact more with the site.</p>
        <p>In conclusion the interface used by the user and the experience that this generates for the user are of
            utmost importance due to the fact that user is the most important aspect of the website as this is who the
            site is designed for, and the better the user experience the more the user will use and visit the site.</p>
