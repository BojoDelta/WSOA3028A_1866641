        <p>Her name was announced, the confetti fell from above, the crowd went wild with screams of elation, joy,
            admiration and sheer awe. JinxKittie Cosplay from South Africa was crowned as The Crown Champion of
            International Cosplay at C2E2. Kelsey Atkins, or as she is more commonly known Jinx/JinxKittie was the 2020
            Crown Cosplay Champion for her cosplay of Blood Priestess Bathory designed by none other than CinderysArt.
        </p>
        <p>More than 1000 hours of work were poured into the amazing cosplay that she crafted and first showed to the
            world at Comic Con Africa 2019. I personally feel so inspired, inspired that I too one day can compete at
            the
            C2E2 championships to represent South Africa.</p>
        <p>I remember the first time I ever laid eyes on this beautiful work of art. It was as I was leaving the cosplay
            change rooms of CCA 2019 that I was absolutely dumbstruck by the details, craftmanship and sheer beauty of
            Jinx's cosplay. I wished in that moment that I could one day be able to create something of that level of
            beauty and skill.</p>
        <p>I wish to extend my greatest congratulations to JinxKittie on her achievement and also to say thank you for
            inspiring me to be the best cosplayer that I can possibly be. You are truly deserving of the title of Queen
            of Cosplay and seeing your cosplay in person will forever be one of my greatest cosplay memories.</p>
