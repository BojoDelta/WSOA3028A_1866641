        <section>
            <p>There is nothing more exciting for a cosplayer than the start of their local Convention season,
                particulary
                for me as a Joburg based cosplayer who often does not have as many conventions to attend as other parts
                of
                the world. However all around the world geek culture conventions are being cancelled and post-poned
                left,
                right and center due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>The following South African geek culture events have already been cancelled or psotponed to next year:
                Comic
                Con Cape Town, FanCon Comic Con, GeekFest and ICON. No official anouncement has been made as of yet with
                regards to Comic Con Africa, rAge, AlterEgos Medieval Fayre, ECT or RUSH.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>One part of me hopes that some conventions later in the year will still continue however the rest of me
                knows
                that the event organizers must do whatever needs to be done in order to ensure the safety of people that
                would attend these conventions.</p>

            <p>Personally I have been using this time of South Africa's lockdown to work on levelling up my cosplay
                skills
                and creating some fantastic cosplay pieces. I know that many other South African cosplayers have been
                doing
                likewise in this time. For those out there who are feeling overwhelmed by everything that is going on
                remember that everything will be alright in the end, and if it's not alright, then it's not the end.</p>
